					"Balrog is Sindarin for ‘demon of might’, and these are mighty foes indeed. According to Tolkien’s later writings, no more than seven of these creatures ever existed. They were Maiar corrupted by Morgoth before the Awakening of the Elves, and it was said that they were his oldest and most trusted servants, and that only winged Fire-Drakes were more terrible in battle. In the First Age, Fëanor was slain by a wound from Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs, and the balrogs rode upon the dragon-back to reach Gondolin during that city’s Fall. Glorfindel fought and killed one by casting it down from a cliff, but he was pulled down with it and died as well.",
					"At the end of the First Age, several were destroyed in the War of Wrath, but some escaped and hid in caverns deep within the earth. None reappear in the tales we have until late in the Third Age, when dwarves mining mithril in Moria awoke one. It slew King Durin VI, and was thereafter called “Durin’s Bane”. Of course, others might exist, and might serve Sauron—or act as independent powers in their own right.",
					"In appearance, a balrog is a humanoid shape all aflame, with horns, hooved legs, and claws of brightly glowing steel. It is surrounded by a cloud of shadow, towering to twice the balrog’s own not-inconsiderable height (Tolkien says they are twice as tall as elves—thus, 10 to 13 feet tall), and flowing out to the side in wing-like extensions."
