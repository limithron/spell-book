				"\"Angus Skyme came to the Spanish Main in the brig of HMSÂ Prudence. He escaped the gallows and gathered the roughest crew in the Caribbean. Blackheart shows no quarter to his victims or crew, and he has killed many of both for his amusement and profit. He still bears the scar from the duel he fought with Jack Hawkins over Lady Arcadia de Sol, and he still nurses the grudge that goes with it.\"",
				"Known to use torture and other unspeakable acts to acquire gold, Blackheart is considered by many to be no better than the Cursed. Still, he is pirate through and through, only too willing to inflict a little bloodshed to guarantee respect.",
				"Some say that Blackheart has already sold his soul to the demons of the sea. Others say that he fights them like he has fought everyone else: to his death or theirs.",
				"Now that Blackheart has carved out an empire based on fear and terror, he can concentrate on his biggest goal: destroying the other pirates of the Spanish Main, starting with Jack Hawkins and his accursed monkey.",
				"â€œNow tell me,â€ Blackheart said, his voice a low growl barely audible above the creaking in the shipâ€™s hold. â€œTell me where you buried De La Cruzâ€™ gold.â€",
				"â€œNever!â€ Sunderland yelled, not quite believing his own feeble reply.",
				"Blackheart shook his shaggy head, and beneath his grizzled beard cracked a smile like a broken dinner plate. He picked up a small chest and placed it on the barrel next to Sunderland, opening it so that the prone Englishman could see its contents. Blackheart extracted a pair of wicked metal implements with seemingly unnecessary blades and teeth.",
				"â€œI think yeâ€™ll change your mind,â€ Blackheart said. Sunderlandâ€™s screams tore through the night, startling the men on watch who looked at each other nervously. Each time the shrieking began again, the helmsman took a drink of rum. An hour later, when Blackheart emerged from the hold, the helmsman could barely stand.",
				"â€œHereâ€™s yer new heading,â€ Blackheart said, dropping a rough map on the deck, drawn in blood on a torn bandage. â€œMake for that island as if Hell itself were on yer heels.â€"
